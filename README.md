## A bit about the website
For absolutely no reason other than it being a challenge, I decided to make this website without any external libraries. If you check out my projects you'll see I love reinventing/reimplementing the wheel so this is just another one of those! Each page has its own js file - there are also a couple barebones libraries I wrote:

### nikoQuery
My terrible library for manipulating the DOM.

### niko-imageview
My very mediocre library for viewing images in a "lightbox".
